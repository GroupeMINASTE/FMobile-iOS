# FMobile for iOS
FMobile Series 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are now open source. That's all of them!

As of January 1st 2022, the entire range of FMobile products is no longer being serviced. FMobile was previously available for download here : https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/fmobile-stop-national-roaming/id1449356942?l=en&mt=8.

To build FMobile Series 1 and use it as intended to be, you will need Xcode 11 (iOS 13.4 SDK), an iPhone running iOS 12 and the following deprecated Shortcuts:

RRFM : https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/63e9ea4e284b4c2e9aee2f941aa3086a

CFM : https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a7c6044d0c8744dea67645c8be417c33

You will probably want to remove the fmobile4() function in order to remove the warning popup inviting you to upgrade to FMobile 4.
If you want to build FMobile 5, it is recommended that you build FMobile 5.0.2 as it contains all the features of FMobile 5. FMobile 5.0.3 is a disabled version that informs the user that the FMobile adventure has ended with the update.



FMobile 2 uses another Shortcut to operate, named ANIRC that replaces the old RRFM shortcut, and that is available for download here: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3cdfd9f060694195a1dfa16c4226832e. FMobile 3 and upwards uses the same ANIRC shortcut to operate.

FMobile 5 has a special Shortcut divided in two parts:
ANIRC12 for iOS 12: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1c0f64e2dbc24c10b1226d42235ef012
ANIRC for iOS 13+: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3cdfd9f060694195a1dfa16c4226832e

FMobile 5 uses a completely new processing engine, FMNetwork, that is avaiable on GitHub separately. If you're intrested in how FMobile was working under the hood, you should visit the GroupeMINASTE/FMNetwork and GroupeMINASTE/FMNetworkExample GitHub repositories instead of building FMobile 5. FMNetwork is a clean Swift package you can integrate in your apps, and has proper documentation already there.


You may use the FMobile Series 1/2/3/4/5 code as you want, but please mention us (FMobile or the Groupe MINASTE) somewhere in your app if you use a big portion of our code (not mendatory but highly appreciated).

You may not request any assistance from the technical support for these version, however you can submit pull requests which we will let in if we believe they are relevent.

FMobile Series 4 and upwards include a coverage map API, which is no longer in use. You are not allowed to make calls to that API, and you won't get any response if you do.
