# FMobile for iOS
FMobile Series 1 and 2 are now open source.

FMobile Series 1 and 2 are no longer supported, if you are interested in this app to be used on your consumer device, please download the free FMobile 5 from here : https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/fmobile-stop-national-roaming/id1449356942?l=en&mt=8.

To build FMobile Series 1 and use it as intended to be, you will need Xcode 11 (iOS 13.4 SDK), an iPhone running iOS 12 and the following deprecated Shortcuts:

RRFM : https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/63e9ea4e284b4c2e9aee2f941aa3086a

CFM : https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a7c6044d0c8744dea67645c8be417c33

You will probably want to remove the fmobile4() function in order to remove the warning popup inviting you to upgrade to FMobile 4.



FMobile 2 use another Shortcut to operate that is no longer available for download, you will need to rename the RRFM shortcut above to ANIRC.


You may use the FMobile Series 1 and 2 code as you want, but please mention us (FMobile or the Groupe MINASTE) somewhere in your app if you use a big portion of our code (not mendatory but highly appreciated).

You may not request any assistance from the technical support for these version, however you can submit pull requests which we will let in if we believe they are relevent.
